# My Portfolio 

Professional developer portfolio showcasing projects, skills, and contact methods.

---

## Description

This is a modern, responsive developer portfolio built with TypeScript and React (Vite). It demonstrates front-end craftsmanship, accessible UI components, theme-aware styling (dark / light), and an organized showcase of projects and experience. The site is intended to present real work, provide a way for visitors to contact the author, and act as a living resume for hiring managers and collaborators.

Key goals:

- Present projects with images, tech stacks, and links to source/demos
- Highlight skills, experience, and testimonials
- Provide an accessible, mobile-first UI with a toggleable theme
- Offer an easy way to contact the developer

## Features

- Project showcase with descriptions, tags, and links (GitHub, Live demo)
- Responsive Hero section and smooth scroll navigation
- Dark / Light theme toggle and system preference detection
- Contact section with an email link (or form integration if configured)
- Experience, Skills, and Testimonials sections
- Accessible navigation and keyboard-friendly components
- Reusable UI primitives/components for fast iteration

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS
- UI: Custom component library (in `src/components/ui`) and accessible primitives
- Build / Tooling: Bun/npm-compatible lockfile, ESLint, TypeScript, Vite
- Hosting: Static-friendly (Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages)
